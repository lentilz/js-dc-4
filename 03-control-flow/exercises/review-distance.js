/**
 * Distance Formula
 *
 * The purpose of this assignment is to build a program that will calculate the
 * distance between two points, given two sets of x and y coordinates.
 *
 * As a refresher (since it's probably been a while since you've done any
 * geometry!), the distance formula works like this: given a point x1, y1 and
 * another point x2, y2 on a graph, we can calculate the distance between these
 * two points by following these steps:
 *
 * 1. subtract x2 from x1 to get deltaX
 * 2. subtract y2 from y1 to get deltaY
 * 3. square both deltaX and deltaY
 * 4. add the square of deltaX to the square of deltaY
 * 5. take the square root of the sum of step 4
