# Assignment
We've built out a simple todo list application using Handlebars and JavaScript!

Now we want to take that application and build it out a little bit.

The following are bonus activities to do on your own. Do the one that you think is interesting!

1. Add options for each todo like 'Complete' and 'Delete'.

You'll need to refactor your template to include links to mark each todo as complete or delete it. Then in your data object, you'll have to modify your todos to be objects (instead of strings in an array) with an isComplete property that is either true or false. Finally, you'll need to create methods that will handle that functionality for when users mark a todo as complete or delete it.


2. Add a Current Todo template

You'll need to create a new template for a Current Todo and give each todo a way to make it the current to do item. While we're at it, lets change our data object so that each todo is an object with a 'description' property that we can show when a to do item is marked as featured. You'll need to write functions to handle making a todo the Current Todo and reorganize your data so one Todo is featured at a time.

If you can think of other features to add, go for it!
