# Assignment

1. Pokdedex - finish up the pokedex exercise. We'll go over the solution together at the beginning of next class.

2. [Express in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action) is a great book about Express and how to use it. Chapter 3 Foundations of Express, is available for free as a sample. Please read Chapter 3 before next class and follow along with the exercises in this folder, except the Guestbook exercise at the end of the chapter (we'll do that one together in class). Submit the code for the exercises by the start of next class.

For extra context or information, review the documentation on [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (it's some of the best documentation out there!).

Additionally, the Express GitHub Repo contains a number of simple example applications built using Express. Read through the code of these [here](https://github.com/expressjs/express/tree/master/examples).
