# Exercise 01
- initialize a project with npm
- install `swap-case` using npm ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/swap-case )
- where does NPM install this library?
- uninstall `swap-case`

# Exercise 02 A
- in `one.js`, write a function called `one` that `console.log`s the number `1` whenever it is called
- in `index.js`, import `one.js` using `require`, just like we did with `data.json` last time. What happens?

# Exercise 02 B
Try these out:
- `console.log` `module` and see what you get
- `console.log` `module.exports`
- if `module.exports` is just an object, can we add properties to it? Why not?

# Exercise 02 C
- in `two.js` save an empty object as a variable. Then create two methods in our object: `one`, which `console.log`s the number `1` and `two`, which `console.log`s the number `2`
- export your object using `module.exports`

# Exercise 02 D
- In `three.js` add three methods to the `module.exports` object: `one`, which `console.log`s `1`; `two`, which `console.log`s `2`; `three`, which `console.log`s `3`
